First, clone the repo and `cd` into the project directory.
```bash

This creates the `env` folder where you can install the modules needed.

Make sure to have these modules insalled to use `stockprediction`.

Run the app with:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
This will open in a new browser tab/window through `localhost`.
